# Deep back plate — ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8

> **Status:** Living · **Last verified:** 2026-09-23

A 3D-printable back cover for the [Waveshare
ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.8.htm), the little
touchscreen that runs the kids' pet (firmware in [`../../firmware/`](../../firmware/README.md)).
The stock back only fits a tiny battery. This one is a deeper box that holds a real one, screws on
with the original four screw positions, and has grip ribs so small hands don't drop it.

## Pick a version

| | [**103035, 1000 mAh**](renders/version-103035.png) (recommended) | [802525, 400 mAh](renders/version-802525.png) | [104050, 2400 mAh](renders/version-104050.png) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | ![](renders/version-103035.png) | ![](renders/version-802525.png) | ![](renders/version-104050.png) |
| Print | `back_plate_103035_1000mAh_edge.stl` | `back_plate_802525_400mAh_flat.stl` | `back_plate_104050_2400mAh_end.stl` |
| Battery sits | on its edge | flat | on its end |
| Finished unit | 37.6 × 45.2 × 44 mm | 37.6 × 45.2 × 24.7 mm | 37.6 × 45.2 × 67 mm |
| Notes | Roomy fit | Thinnest | Tight fit — measure the cell first |

Green is the battery, red the tape under it, yellow the foam on top. Optional:
`amoled18_hole_plugs.stl`, press-in caps that hide the screw openings — **not for babies, they're
a choking hazard**.

## Or: the desk stand

![The desk stand: the box lies on its side, the screen leans back 30°, USB-C and buttons along the top](renders/stand.png)

A two-part version for a desk. A thin **head** screws to the display in place of the stock
cover, then sinks right into the angled end of a plain **battery box**, held by six flush
countersunk screws round its rim. The box's rim is the case outline, so the front shell sits
flush on it and the head is hidden inside. The box lies on its long flat side, and the screen
faces you, landscape, leaning back 30° from upright, with the USB-C and buttons along its top
edge.
The head is the same for every box, so changing battery only means printing another box.

Each is cut open as it sits on the table, you on the right: battery green, tape red, foam yellow.

## Safety

These go to small children. Keep the hole plugs away from babies (glue them in or leave them
off), never squeeze a lithium pouch cell, don't install one that's puffed or damaged, check the
battery plug's polarity before connecting it, and don't leave it charging unattended.
