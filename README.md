# Deep back plate — ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8

> **Status:** Living · **Last verified:** 2026-09-23

A 3D-printable back cover for the
[Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.8.htm),
the little touchscreen that runs the kids' pet (firmware in [`../../firmware/`](../../firmware/README.md)).
The stock back only fits a tiny battery. This one is a deeper box that holds a real one, screws
on with the original four screw positions, and has grip ribs so small hands don't drop it.

## Pick a version

| | [**103035, 1000 mAh**](renders/version-103035.png) (recommended) | [802525, 400 mAh](renders/version-802525.png) | [104050, 2400 mAh](renders/version-104050.png) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | ![](renders/version-103035.png) | ![](renders/version-802525.png) | ![](renders/version-104050.png) |
| Print | `back_plate_103035_1000mAh_edge.stl` | `back_plate_802525_400mAh_flat.stl` | `back_plate_104050_2400mAh_end.stl` |
| Battery sits | on its edge | flat | on its end |
| Finished unit | 37.6 × 45.2 × 44 mm | 37.6 × 45.2 × 24.7 mm | 37.6 × 45.2 × 67 mm |
| Notes | Roomy fit | Thinnest | Tight fit — measure the cell first |

Green is the battery, red the tape under it, yellow the foam on top. Optional:
`amoled18_hole_plugs.stl`, press-in caps that hide the screw openings — **not for babies, they're
a choking hazard**.

## Or: the desk stand

![The desk stand: the unit lies landscape, tilted up 30°, USB-C and buttons along the top](renders/stand.png)

A two-part version for a desk. A thin **head** screws to the display in place of the stock
cover, and drops into the angled top of a plain **battery box** that sits flat on the table,
held by one screw at each end. The unit lies landscape, tilted up 30°, with the USB-C and
buttons on the top edge. The head is the same for every box, so changing battery only means
printing another box.

| | 103035, 1000 mAh (recommended) | 802525, 400 mAh | 104050, 2400 mAh |
|---|---|---|---|
| Print | `amoled18_stand_head.stl` + `amoled18_stand_box_103035_edge.stl` | head + `amoled18_stand_box_802525_flat.stl` | head + `amoled18_stand_box_104050_end.stl` |
| Box, front / back height | 23 / 44 mm | 11 / 32 mm | 48 / 69 mm |
| Notes | Roomy | Lowest | Tight fit — measure the cell first |

Every box is 36 mm front to back and 50 mm wide. How to print and assemble it:

## Safety

These go to small children. Keep the hole plugs away from babies (glue them in or leave them
off), never squeeze a lithium pouch cell, don't install one that's puffed or damaged, check the
battery plug's polarity before connecting it, and don't leave it charging unattended.
