# Deep back plate — ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8

> **Status:** Living · **Last verified:** 2026-09-23

A 3D-printable back cover for the
[Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.8.htm),
the little touchscreen that runs the kids' pet (firmware in [`../../firmware/`](../../firmware/README.md)).
The stock back only fits a tiny battery. This one is a deeper box that holds a real one, screws
on with the original four screw positions, and has grip ribs so small hands don't drop it.

## Pick a version

| | [**103035, 1000 mAh**](renders/version-103035.png) (recommended) | [802525, 400 mAh](renders/version-802525.png) | [104050, 2400 mAh](renders/version-104050.png) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | ![](renders/version-103035.png) | ![](renders/version-802525.png) | ![](renders/version-104050.png) |
| Print | `back_plate_103035_1000mAh_edge.stl` | `back_plate_802525_400mAh_flat.stl` | `back_plate_104050_2400mAh_end.stl` |
| Battery sits | on its edge | flat | on its end |
| Finished unit | 37.6 × 45.2 × 44 mm | 37.6 × 45.2 × 24.7 mm | 37.6 × 45.2 × 67 mm |
| Notes | Roomy fit | Thinnest | Tight fit — measure the cell first |

Green is the battery, red the tape under it, yellow the foam on top.

### Variation: tilted stand

| ![Standing on a table, leaning back 20°](renders/fig-tilt-stand.png) | ![The sloped base underneath](renders/tilt-under.png) |
|---|---|

`back_plate_802525_400mAh_tilt20.stl` — the thin 802525 version with its bottom-back corner cut
flat at 20°, so the unit stands on a table leaning back like a little screen. Unit 37.6 × 45.2 ×
24.7 mm. Only the thin, flat-battery versions can tilt: in the deep ones the slope would run
through the battery. See [the stand](MODEL_ADJUSTMENT.md#tilted-stand).

Optional:
`amoled18_hole_plugs.stl`, press-in caps that hide the screw openings — **not for babies, they're
a choking hazard**.

## The guides

| Change it: another battery, a better fit, different grip | [**MODEL_ADJUSTMENT.md**](MODEL_ADJUSTMENT.md) |

## Safety

These go to small children. Keep the hole plugs away from babies (glue them in or leave them
off), never squeeze a lithium pouch cell, don't install one that's puffed or damaged, check the
battery plug's polarity before connecting it, and don't leave it charging unattended.
