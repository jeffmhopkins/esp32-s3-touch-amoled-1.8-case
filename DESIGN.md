How the plate is built, why, and where every number came from. You don't need this to print or
adjust it. Back to the [README](README.md).

![Cut through two screw towers](renders/cutaway.png)

## Battery cavity

The plate is a box with straight walls. The whole inside is open apart from four screw towers,
and its depth follows the battery. The cell sits on tape with foam on top, and the cavity is
deliberately not shaped to the cell: gaps are packed with foam. All ports, buttons and the mic
are in the front shell, so the plate has no other openings.

- **Orientation.** The screws pass through 24 mm apart across the case, so a wide cell can't lie
  flat past them. On its **edge** a cell is only its thickness wide there; on its **end** its
  length becomes the plate's depth, so any length fits.
- **Wire room.** A pouch cell's wires leave one end. `lead_end` (2 mm) keeps that free; the
  default still has 1.85 mm spare at each end beyond it. A 40 mm cell such as an 852540 doesn't
  fit flat or on its edge once its wires have room.
- **Clearances.** The console warns `TIGHT` when anything comes within 0.5 mm of the cell and
  refuses to export under 0.2 mm, because real cells run up to half a millimetre over.
- **Bracing.** A 45° chamfer where the walls meet the floor (`wall_chamfer`, 3 mm) and a 45°
  flare where each tower meets it (`tower_flare`, 2 mm). Both shrink near the cell to stay
  0.5 mm off its bottom edge, so they never lift it.
- **The board's `BAT` connector** stands 3.5 mm off the back of the board, on one long side about
  halfway along. The flat 802525 sits under it, so that version leaves 2 mm extra above the cell.
- **The rim** is the top of the wall itself (0.8 mm), so it stands squarely on the wall with
  nothing overhanging. Its opening is the cavity.

## Screws

The screws thread into brass hex standoffs soldered to the **board**, not the case. They stand up
from the board and end exactly level with the front shell's edge. On the stock cover a post
around each screw presses its standoff, so tightening clamps the board. This plate does the same
with four hollow towers:

- The bore (Ø4.6) takes the screw head and hex key up to the **seat**, 2 mm of plastic at the top
  (`head_seat`). The screw only passes through the seat into the standoff, so short screws work
  at any plate height.
- The tower top is flat and full width (Ø7) and stops at the seam, level with the front shell's
  edge, where it presses squarely on the standoff (`tower_drop` = 2, the rim's height). The rim
  then goes its full 2 mm into the shell. If the top ever needs to stand clear of parts near a
  standoff, `nut_pad_h` raises a Ø4.5 pad around it instead.
- A thin skin (`bridge_skin`, 0.4 mm — two layers) closes each bore so the printer can bridge it;
  it's cleared at assembly.

**Screw length.** The screw passes the 2 mm seat and goes into the standoff; M2 × 4 gives 2 mm of
thread in it, M2 × 5 gives 3. Push a stock screw through the stock cover to see how far it goes
into its standoff, and don't go much past that: the standoff's thread may not run its full
length. On the desk stand's head the seat is 1.4 mm (the head is too thin for a socket head
under a 2 mm seat), so its M2 × 4 go 2.6 mm in.

## Hole plugs

A shallow recess (Ø5.6 × 0.8) at each tower opening, and plugs with a thin cap and a ribbed
shank: six ribs that crush slightly going in, for a press fit with no glue. A small gap around
each cap lets a knife tip pry it out. They're a choking hazard for babies.

![A fitted plug in section](renders/fig-tower-bottom.png)

## Grip

Horizontal ribs right round the outside, corners included: bands 3 mm tall, 0.3 mm proud by
default (`grip_depth`, 0–0.5), with 45° slopes top and bottom so they print without supports.
They stop 1.5 mm short of the bed edge and the seam.

## The tall 104050 version

A 104050 (10 × 40 × 50 mm, sold as 2400 mAh; expect about 2000) standing on its 10 × 40 face,
wires at the top, about 67 mm tall overall. Its 40 mm width sits in a 40.7 mm opening — 0.35 mm
per end, hence "measure first"; set `lip_wall` to 0.6 for 41.1 mm if it's over. The common
listing ships a JST PH 2.0 plug that needs swapping for 1.25 mm. The screws are the same M2 × 4;
the hex driver needs a 60 mm shaft.

## The desk stand

![The desk stand from the side](renders/fig-stand-side.png)

Two parts, so the box stays a plain box and the part that meets the display stays the stock
cover's shape. The head that ships adds a collar and a few fit changes to what's described
below (the model's defaults, which the boxes are built from); see
[The collar head](#the-collar-head) at the end of this section.

- **The head** is the plate at stock depth (5.5 mm) with no battery room: same rim, same four
  towers, so it fits the front shell exactly as the stock cover does. It is smaller than the case
  by the box's rim wall, with tighter corners (R5.55) so the wall outside each screw bore stays 1
  mm thick. It adds a solid block for each lock screw inside its short ends (left and right in
  use), and a slot through the floor just in front of the board's `BAT` socket, whose mouth faces
  the slot (from Waveshare's 3D model). The socket is on the side away from the USB-C, which fixes
  which way round the head goes. Its back edge has no chamfer, so all of it bears on the ledge,
  and its tower flares don't change with the battery, so one head fits every box.
- **The box** is a straight-walled prism, printed standing on its floor. Its open end is cut at
  `stand_angle`, and the head sinks into it: its back rests on a ledge `stand_ledge` wide inside,
  and round it the box's wall carries on `pocket_wall` thick to the seam, where the front shell
  sits on it. The outside of that band is the case outline, so box and front shell are flush;
  the head's rim stands above the seam into the front shell as usual. Below the ledge the box is
  open under the head, so the head's back is its lid. Where its walls meet the floor there's a
  45° chamfer, kept under the tape beside the cell as on the plate.
- **How it sits.** In use the box lies on its long flat wall, with the cut end facing you, so the
  screen leans back `stand_angle` from upright. The display goes in with its USB-C edge (the
  head's +x, where the two buttons are too) to the box's short wall, which puts it along the top.
  Nothing of the box stands past the seam, so the USB-C plug and the buttons are clear. Lying on
  a side 45 mm wide and as long as the box, it's low and steady.
- **Box size.** The cell lies on that long flat wall, as far along it as its corners allow 0.5 mm
  from the rounded corners. The box is then made just long enough that the head clears the top of
  the cell (in the print frame) plus tape, foam, wires and `extra_clearance`, but its short wall
  is never shorter than `stand_front_min`. The box is modelled in its print frame; `part = stand`
  shows it lying as it's used (`stand_pose()` in the `.scad`).
- **Printing.** Standing on its floor, the box's walls are vertical and its cut end slopes at
  `stand_angle`, so it prints with no supports; the band's walls lean at that angle too, the
  same as the front shell's. The band is 1.1 mm at the sides and about 1.3 mm along the long and
  short walls.
- **Screws.** Four M2 × 4 hold the display to the head, as on the plate, though here the seat is
  1.4 mm and the holes 2.1 mm deep so a socket head fits inside the thin head. Six M2 × 8
  countersunk lock screws hold the head in the box: two on each side, `lock_spread` (14 mm) apart,
  and one each in the top and bottom, diagonally opposite so they clear the battery slot and the
  head still fits either way round. Each goes through the band round the box's angled end into a
  lock block in the head, cutting its own thread about 5.6 mm deep. An M2 countersunk head needs
  only a 0.8 mm 90° seat, so the heads sit flush in the 1.1 mm band. The holes are 1.45 mm up from
  the ledge, which keeps each seat under the seam with the front shell; its lower edge dips into
  the solid wall below the ledge.
- **Pads and notches.** The band alone is 1.1 mm, thin for a screw to clamp on, so at each screw
  the box has a pad on the band's inside, 6 mm wide, reaching `lock_pad` (1.0 mm) in — no further
  than the ledge, so it stands on solid wall — and the head has a matching notch in its edge. The
  wall under each screw head is 2.25 mm. The notch's roof, and the pad's top, slope at 45°, so the
  head's rim above each notch is held up by solid plastic instead of printing as a bridge. The
  pads also key the head into the box before it's screwed.

### The collar head

The head that ships (`amoled18_stand_head.stl`, preset **Desk stand: head (fits every box)**)
is the head above with these changes; `amoled18_stand_head_no_collar.stl` (preset **Desk
stand: head, no collar**) has all of them but the collar. Each one came from fitting a stand
on a second unit, where the stock head was loose in the box and the front shell sat above it.

- **A 3 mm collar** (`collar_h`). Above the box's band the head widens to the case outline,
  so the box, collar and front shell are flush. The part in the box (`pocket_h`) is unchanged,
  so the boxes are too.
- **Tower tops 0.5 mm below the seam** (`tower_drop` = `lip_h` + 0.5), so standoffs that reach
  past the shell's edge can't hold it up. The screw seat stays 2 mm thanks to the collar, and
  the screws become M2 × 5.
- **Lock blocks stay in the box** (they stop at `pocket_h`), 3 mm below the seam, and join
  their nearest tower (`lock_block_join`) so there's no narrow V between them.
- **A 1.5 mm rim** (`lip_h`; `stock_clear` drops with it so the part in the box stays 3.5 mm).
- **0.05 mm gaps** to the box and inside the shell (`pocket_clear`, `lip_slop`), with the
  lock-pad notches 0.1 mm deeper (`lock_pad`, `stand_ledge` 1.1) to match.

([resources page](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8/Resources-And-Documents)),
and the photos in `photos/`. Copies are kept in [`reference/`](reference/README.md), with
`reference/measure.py` to re-derive them. The 3D model has the board and display but not the case.

| Default | Value | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plate_x` × `plate_y` | 37.6 × 45.2 | Case outline, dimension drawing | High (official) |
| `screw_dx`, `screw_dy` | 12.0, 18.0 (24 × 36 apart) | PCB mounting holes in the 3D model; drawing and photos agree within ~0.7 mm | High |
| `plate_r` | 8.7 | Circle fitted to the drawing's corners | Good, ±0.5 |
| `lip_outer_x` × `lip_outer_y`, `lip_outer_r` | 35.0 × 42.6, 7.4 | Outline minus a ~1.3 mm front-shell wall, from the photos (the board is 33.0 × 40.6) | Estimate: measure |
| `lip_h` | 2.0 | Not visible in any source | Guess: measure |
| `stock_clear` | 3.9 | Stock cover shows 3.5 mm in the side view; derived with the rim height | Estimate |
| `tower_drop` | 2.0 (= `lip_h`) | The board's standoffs end level with the front shell's edge ([photos](#screws)); 0 left a 2 mm gap at the seam on the first print | Measured |
| `lip_wall` | 0.8 | Chosen: the rim's inside is the cavity; 0.8 leaves a 40.7 mm opening | Design choice |
| `screw_size` | M2 | Heads ~3.8 mm across in the drawing (stock ones are Phillips) | Likely |
| Tower bore | Ø4.6 | ISO 4762 M2 head (Ø3.8) + `head_clear` 0.6 + `hole_slop` 0.2 | Standard |

For reference: the stock unit is 15.0 mm thick; Waveshare's largest recommended cell for the
stock case is 3.85 × 24 × 28 mm; the stock back label window is 27.6 × 27.6 mm, R1.8.

## Regenerating the images

Every image in these guides is rendered from the model: `renders/make_renders.sh` rebuilds them
all (OpenSCAD 2021+; on a headless machine it uses `xvfb-run`). The figure sources are in
`renders/src/`; the labelled ones draw their dimension lines and text in OpenSCAD itself
(`renders/src/annot.scad`), so a change to the model only needs a re-run.

The photoreal shots on the README, `renders/hero-<plate|stand>-<orange|black>.jpg`, come from
`renders/photoreal/make_photoreal.sh` instead: Blender (Cycles, as the `bpy` module) renders
the printed parts exported from the model, Waveshare's STEP of the board and panel (the copy in
`reference/`, checksummed), and a pet frame drawn by the JBrain2 firmware's `face.c` (saved in
`renders/photoreal/screens/`; set `FIRMWARE` to a firmware checkout to redraw it). The STEP has
no case, so the black front shell in those shots is drawn from the case outline and the
[photos](#screws): the board hangs on standoffs that end at the seam (taken as 4 mm), which puts
the glass just under the shell's face. It takes about 25 minutes on four cores and needs `python3.11`; re-run it only
when a change shows from outside.
