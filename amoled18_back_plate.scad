// PARAMETRIC BACK PLATE
// Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8  (replaces the stock black cover)
//
// The stock back is a flat plate with a shallow rim. All ports, buttons
// and the mic live in the FRONT shell, so this part is solid except for
// the battery cavity and four screw holes.
//
// Group 7 builds a two-part desk stand instead: a thin head that screws to
// the display, and a battery box it sinks into (see DESIGN.md).
//
// EVERY dimension is adjustable. In OpenSCAD open
//     Window > Customizer
// and the parameters appear as labelled fields and sliders, grouped by
// section. No code editing required.
//
// Workflow:  set values  >  F5 preview  >  F6 render  >  F7 export STL
//
// NOTE ON SCREWS: each screw sits in a hollow tower. Its head rests near
// the top, so the tower presses on the board's nut as the stock cover's
// posts do, and a short standard socket head screw is enough. Drive it
// down the tower with a long hex key.
//
// Units: millimetres.   OpenSCAD is free at openscad.org
